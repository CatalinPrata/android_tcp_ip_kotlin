# Simple Android (Kotlin) TCP/IP messaging example


This is a simple **Android phone/tablet** Kotlin messaging example. The communication is done via 2 Android devices(will do a Kotlin desktop app later on) that support wifi and are in the same network. It uses TCP sockets to send/receive the messages from one to another. This is just a simple pet project to exercise my skills with various technologies. 

## This is work in progress for now! :) 

#### I would like to try out the following Android APIs:
- Kotlin Coroutines (replace the current AsyncTask)
- Kotlin Flow (listen to messages using Flow instead of the traditional callback)
- Jetpack's Architecture Components ViewModel + LiveData (moving away from the ugly "do it all" activity)
- Unit testing the thing (see how all the above can be tested to cover our a*s)
